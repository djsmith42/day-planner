## Minimal React ES6 Starter Project

A starter project as small as humanly possible. If you can you make it smaller, I'll give you a hug.

### 90 seconds

You can seriously read every line of code in this project in 90 seconds. Even if you read pretty
carefully. It's puny. In fact, it will take you longer to read this README than all the rest of
the files in this project, combined!

### Quick Start

```ShellSession
npm install -g webpack # for the webpack command
npm install
npm start
# Go to http://localhost:8080
```
You wanted minimal, so don't read any of the stuff below.

### Project description

This project aims to provide the **bare minimum** to get started with React in ES6.
If you've been frustrated by the massive size of other starter projects, this may
be nicer for you. Just look at that package.json. It's tiny! Small webpack config?
You got it!

This project provides:

 * React
 * Webpack
 * ES6 (via Babel)
 * JSX (via Babel)
 * Browser auto-refresh on code change

This project **does not** have:

 * Hot module reloading
 * Production deployment
 * Gulp/Grunt
 * Unit tests
 * CSS pre-processor
 * CSS modules
 * Lint
 * And much more!!
